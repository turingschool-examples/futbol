 * working in a Group
 * project mgmt - better at planning a project
 * improve organizational skills with classes, methods, adding in modules &/or inheritance
 * diagraming file structure

* What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
 * HS/TD/X - divide and conquer preferred - but can do both - situational
 * KF/TS - prefers paired
 * start together -> divide and conquer in smaller groups later

* How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
 * immediate but not reactive
 * direct with explanation

* How would you describe your work style?
 * head down and bang it out
 * need overarching goals/ game plan/ concept

* What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?
  * HS - refactoring - breaking down methods
  * X - string manipulation
  * TD - data structures & ruby mechanics - communicating process/ explaining what he's doing
  * KF - growth oriented - learns well from watching others work through the problem
  * TS - process oriented and procedural, communication

* Whatâ€™s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
 * poorly -

* How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project? How will we overcome obstacles?
