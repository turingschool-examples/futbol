# Futbol

# Scheduled Check-Ins
Every weekday at 8:30am MT before class to discuss new code and merge all pending PRs.

# Project Organization / Workflow
Every day we will do a 3 driver/1 float model, where 3 different coders are working on different sections of project functionality, and one person is there to hop in when needed. The float can work on exercises/prep for IC when they're not coding or helping a teammate. We are using the github projects board to keep a running checklist of the methods that have already been coded for. Here is the link: https://github.com/users/jdmchugh111/projects/1

# Different Approaches
We discussed as a group our preferred workflows, and ultimately decided to do a hybrid of async and driver/navigator. By having 3 drivers per day, we maximize productivity, allow for async indpendent exploration, but also have the option to loop in a partner(s) as needed to do paired/team coding.

# Project Design
We discussed having the three statistics categories (Game, League, Season) separated out into modules. This way, we can have the different categories of stat methods more organized, and also avoid potential merge conflicts.
