# Futbol

Starter repository for the [Turing School](https://turing.io/) Futbol project.
A 1-2 summary or bullet points outlining your plan for check-ins throughout the duration of the project.

- We are going to check in with a 10-minute standup every morning before class. 
- 8:40 on weekdays, later in the day on the weekend (TBD on Friday)
- Checkins with group Slack messages with each new pull request + after merging pull requests

A 2-4 sentence summary of your plan for project organization and workflow. This can include bullet points. If you plan to use a project management tool, please include a link to your project board.

- Main project organization is on Github projects
  1 Creating Tasks within Github projects - whomever is assigned to that task will move the task form 'to do' to 'in progress' to 'done'
  2 Group expectations tab - includes etiquette for how certain pull requests and things are to be done
- Some structural planning will be hosted on Miro
- Group Slack huddles to discuss roles

A 2-3 sentence summary describing the different approaches your group discussed for project organization and how you collectively made a decision on which to use.

- Working in large group at the beginning of the project to establish framework
- Working individually or in Driver-Navigator pairs on individual methods / classes as assigned in Github Projects
- Parallelizing workflow so that tasks are being worked on simultaneously.
- Pull requests are reviewed by 2 members of the team before being merged.
- 

A 2-3 sentence summary describing your approach to the code design.

- First step, create StatTracker class and spec StatTracker file to write and test methods - 
  1 this is to identify patterns that we can then reference when refactoring and creating classes with a single purpose. 
- Using information gained from StatTracker, we can design classes each with a single repsonsibility. 
- Having all the methods written out beforehand will give us a better idea of what data needs to be available to which class
- While refactoring, look for opportunities to institute Modules and class inheritance 

Include link to your initial DTR document and the date it was completed. If you do additional DTRs later in the project, you should link the revised versions here as well with the date. New versions should be listed alongside older versions. Do not delete old DTRs.
