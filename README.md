# Team Awesome Futbol
##### *AKA Nick & the BBs*
##### *AKA Nick's Abandonment Issues Redux: The Team*

## Check-ins:
- Stand-up meetings @ 8:30 am 
- We'll in on slack regularly
- We plan to break up into smaller groups and code in pairs as needed 
- We plan to hang out in the same study hall during scheduled work times

## Project Organization
We're using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/4kEFl1HGiODQHxy32ZT2RX/Futbol?node-id=10-108&t=GdnVm8WqnI1rBy03-0) to design our code.

We're using [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/users/NickTassinari/projects/2) for project organization.

We chose to use GitHub Projects to gain experience with this platform. We also liked that GitHub Projects can be linked to the actual repository. We picked the project management tool that seemed most attractive and viable to all of us without further ado.
