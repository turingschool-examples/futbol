### Check-Ins
*A 1-2 summary or bullet points outlining your plan for check-ins throughout the duration of the project.*
We plan on having a daily check-in at the start of our daily afternoon "work time" periods.  This allows for both morning and night folks to have time to work on their portions of the project before meeting midday to discuss next steps. Additionally, we'd like to meet over the weekend and plan to do so at 2PM MST on both Saturday and Sunday, to account for people's calendars.

### Project Organization and Workflow
*A 2-4 sentence summary of your plan for project organization and workflow. This can include bullet points. If you plan to use a project management tool, please include a link to your project board.*
We will be using three primary tools to support our project organization and workflow: GitHub, Miro, and GitHubProjects
- Git Workflow: At least one person reviews/approves any pull requests.  If coding was done in a pair, the reviewer(s) should not be from that pair and should instead be one of the other group members.  As long as there is one approval of any PR, the branch may be merged into the main.
- Project Planning ([Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNn0uXp4=/?share_link_id=448426190847)) - We're using it as a way to brainstorm different ideas/approaches.  We're also using it to organize/categorize the different methods we're creating and the data sources they come from.  Potential for some task management in here as well.  
- Project Management ([GitHubProjects](https://github.com/users/wallacebilly1/projects/1)) - We will be using GitHubProjects to manage our tasks (issues).  After deciding on the structure of our project, we will assign issues to people that they will work their way through using the Projects views.

*A 2-3 sentence summary describing the different approaches your group discussed for project organization and how you collectively made a decision on which to use.* 
We discussed using both FreeForm and Miro for project organization, but eventually landed on Miro because it is more complete system and has additional features that Freeform did not.  Additionally, Miro is far better from the UX perspective than FreeForm in our group's opinion.  We also discussed whether we would do our task management through Miro or GitHubProjects and landed on GitHubProjects because of it's integration with GitHub Repositories and Pull Requests.  We will be using GitHubProjects to track our progress towards creating the various methods outlined in Iteration 2.

### Code Design
*A 2-3 sentence summary describing your approach to the code design.*
Utilizing the CSV's in the Repo, we went through all of the headers and looked for similiarities.  We then matched what data source would be needed for each method described in Iteration 2.  Then we went through the classes we wanted to create and figured out which instance variables would need to be pulled from each CSV file.  This allowed us to filter out a lot of the data that was un-needed and bring in the data that's relevant to the classes we'll be creating.

*Top 3 things that went well during your project*
- We are communicating well with each other, even opting to excessively communicate VS under communicate.
- Use of Slack has been a great tool for updating each other and our tasks.
- We initially planned on iro very well, it was an effective vision boarding project.

*Top 3 things your team would do differently next time*
- Having more specifics for our Git Workflow agreements, example, a clear way of naming branches or commit titles, check VS merge pull requests.
- Come to group meetings prepared to talk about what is on the agenda.
- More focus on updating the project board, good use for check ins.
