# Futbol

Starter repository for the [Turing School](https://turing.io/) Futbol project.

## Iteration 1 Deliverable

1. We plan to meet everymorning at 8am MT/ 10am EST for standups to discuss the current state of the project.  In addition to project checkins we have our RETRO scheduled for Sunday.

2. We are utilizing our google jamboard to brainstorm our class methods and code design.  We are using GitHub Projects to track our progress.  We created a dedicated Slack channel for easy communication and will use that on an as-needed basis.

 3. We used jamboard to organize all of the methods within their respective classes.  We collectively discussed what made the most sense for each method in each class. 

 4. We used the Single Responsility Principle to organize classes in ways that fit the categories outline in the "code design" section within Iteration 1.  This has also been a topic of discussion in our standups.
