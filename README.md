# Futbol


## Check-in plan for Futbol project

  Our team will be conducting daily "stand-up" meetings where we will meet for a short 10-15 minutes each morning to assess what part of the project needs to be worked on for the day. After our initial DTR completed prior to beginning iteration 1, we will complete a mid-project DTR to assess if any changes or pivots to approaching the rest of the project need to be made. We will be meeting with professors for two separate check-ins to review the progress of our project. Finally we will complete a retro as a group to review what parts went well with our project as well as what we could have improved at the end of our project. 


## Project Organization & Workflow

  Project progress has been completed synchronously to far, as the project progresses and tasks are divided up to individuals we will use the tool links provided below to track our progress. Rules were added to GitHub for the project to account for reviews of merge pull requests prior to merging data to the main project.

## Approaches to project organization

  - Will documented our metting plans via google document agenda as well as creating the DTR google doc for the team to fill out togeter
  - As a team we added our thoughts to a Miro board for a project outline 
  - Then any actionable items to work through the steps in the project outline were entered as items into GitHub projects. 
 

## Approach to code design

  - As a group we assessed the Futbol setup pages for iterations 1 and 2
  - All team members cloned the project repo forked by Jeff in order to review the CSV files for game/team/game-teams together. 
  - To review the code - we compared the setup pages and the CSV files from the repo to create an outline on the Miro board to decide what classes and methods we wanted to create for the project.
