# **Futbol**

### Plan

- We will be using 10/15 minute standup meetings every day via Zoom or huddle.
- We will collaborate on work that was done, and update tasks on Jira. 
- We will also leave comments on our pull requests when making them and when merging.


### Workflow

- We are using Miro for the flow of our project, utilizing the charts to map out our ideas. 
- For project organization, we are using Jira for task management. 
- We also talked about workflow in terms sync vs async. We seem to all like using our time to work mostly together either in pairs or the whole the group.

### Organization

- We decided what organization tools/software to use that would best suit our design. Along with the best tools, we discussed our ideal work-styles and came to a conclusion of how we are going to work moving forward.

### Approach

- We are using Miro to map out our code design. Using Miro designs we are able to map out our flow with flow charts and to better visualize our strategies going forward. 

### Sucesses

- Our group was very efficient, timely, and worked together. 
- We all made time to support each other when in need. 
- Our group did well at spreading the coding out so all can learning.


### Future Alterations
- In future projects we could work on our punctuality when it comes to meetings.
- read instructions fully in order to have a complete setup. 
- Pair the making of methods and test closer in time.
