Deliverables
Your iteration deliverable is to create a README with the following. As you craft your answers, consider how you might talk about these same topics in a job interview after you graduate.

A 1-2 summary or bullet points outlining your plan for check-ins throughout the duration of the project.

A 2-4 sentence summary of your plan for project organization and workflow. This can include bullet points. If you plan to use a project management tool, please include a link to your project board.

A 2-3 sentence summary describing the different approaches your group discussed for project organization and how you collectively made a decision on which to use.

A 2-3 sentence summary describing your approach to the code design.

Include link to your initial DTR document and the date it was completed. If you do additional DTRs later in the project, you should link the revised versions here as well with the date. New versions should be listed alongside older versions. Do not delete old DTRs.

Create a section in your README called “Contributors”. List each group member’s name and link to their LinkedIn and Github profiles.
