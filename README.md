# Futbol

## Plan Summary
- We plan to check in everyday during our work time
- On Friday we will assess whether or not we need to meet during the weekend

## Workflow Plan
- We will be using a [Trello](https://trello.com/b/VVJuBHIM/futbol-project) board to keep track of what needs to be done. We will also be able to assign methods to specific people in order to divide the workload up.

## Project Organization
- We took the first night to brainstorm on our own about how we wanted to organize the project. We then had a discussion and determined we were going to split our project into Game Statistic, League Statistic, and Season Statistic classes. We also discussed possibly refactoring repeated methods into a module.

## Code Design
- We are going to have three different classes that are split by similar types of statistics. Inside of these classes we will have their respective methods. Once we have these methods and classes implemented the way that we want we will think about refactoring repeated methods into a module.
