Our group has decided to meet regularly on weekdays at 08:30 MST before class to fill each other in on progress and discuss the next steps.  We plan on using that time to cover anything that came up over the last night of work.  We will update our checklists accordingly and reevaluate what the new priorities are.  We are keeping meeting minutes each time we're all together in case we forget anything and to track progress.

We began using a simple Google doc to get the ball rolling with organization, but it seems like everyone is comfortable bringing a Trello workspace onboard as well.  We have successfully outlined the first several steps and have delegated them evenly to each member.  We have our "Swim Lanes" set up on Trello and are learning how to make the most of its tools.  We have a color-coded tagging system to know who's working on what task at a glance.  We have a Draw.io document to help visualize the structural breakdown of what we're up against.

No one in our group had a strong preference for what organizational strategy or tool they wanted to use.  We had some minor experience with Trello and after all playing around with it decided it would serve our needs.  There are undoubtedly many useful tools built in we are not even aware of yet.  The Google docs will also continue to serve us as they allow more flexibility in the type of content we can upload/manipulate.

We've all read the project requirements individually, shared notes, and begun to outline our plan of attack.  We're making sure everyone understands the project objective on a higher level and breaking it down into smaller chunks in order to delegate those chunks to individual members.  We're doing our best to recognize which steps go where and approach this linearly.
