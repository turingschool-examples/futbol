  * Frequent communication via Slack will be the standard.

**Project Organizer Discussion**
  * When discussing the project organization tool, we considered Mirrorboard and Github Projects, but ultimately chose Github Projects due to its utility and seamless integration with our repository.
  * We all agreed Github Project is most likely the industry standard and it would behoove us to familiarize ourselves with the application.

**Code Design**
  * Expand upon this.
  * We have implemented a style guide to adhere to for consistency.
