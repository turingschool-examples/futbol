# Futbol

Starter repository for the [Turing School](https://turing.io/) Futbol project.

# Group Commitments and DTR
- As a group, we will check in regularly as we work on branches and move through iterations. Every merge will have a group checkin.


- We will move through the iterations and divy up assignments. Each member will create branches as they work on their assignment. We will most likely also have testing branches, in addition to the code branches. All merges will be looked at by the group and we will pr merge and update our local mains together.

- A blend of async work and driver/navigator as needed when we run into problems or come together for merges. We will also look at using Trello.

- We will try to be as DRY as possible. Refactoring is built-in to iteration 3, but we will try to maek our code as single responsible as possible as we work through.

# Include link to your initial DTR document and the date it was completed. If you do additional DTRs later in the project, you should link the revised versions here as well with the date. New versions should be listed alongside older versions. Do not delete old DTRs.
