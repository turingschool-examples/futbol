Check-Ins

* Standups (what did you do yesterday, what will you do today, are you blocked on anything)
  * During scheduled work time.
  * Slack message of the same information as above on the weekend.

Project Organization

* Created project management board in Trello and Google Sheets to compare the two.
* Using Miro to sketch out class structure and method flow in a flow diagram.
* Will self assign Trello tickets based on methods on 6/7 for async work.
* Trello: [Link](https://trello.com/b/8ReVyYLY/futbolhttps:/)
* Google Sheets: [Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YA3LX85hV-Ohxf_duq2SnGeDf0Khd6s3ENpZlSsFh6M/edit?usp=sharing)
* Miro: [Link](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMBWhmqA=/?share_link_id=316400926794)

Approaches to Project Organization

* We all discussed tools we've used in the past and compared a few.
* We wanted a project management tool with cards to show the project's progress as well as a tool to create graphical flowcharts to visualize the workflow.
* Ultimately the final decision on tools were made by group consensus.

Approaches to Code Design

* Logically ordered the various datasets by level of dependency and encapsulation.
* Utilized flowchart to collaborate on the structure by comparing the CSV data.

Re-DTR

* We revisited our initial DTR as a group and decided not to edit anything.

Retro

* Completed 6/11
* We used a tool called Easy Retro. It is a collaborative workspace similar to Trello but to use during live discussion. Here is a link to the board we worked on together live during our zoom call: [Retro Workspace](https://easyretro.io/publicboard/fMKwvKTF02gj6GDFT5rTOF4XXU93/e482bf75-43d6-472d-ad2e-45ad23ed6259?list=false)
* Top 3 Things that Went Well
  - We were able to adapt and change direction of our project when necessary with a group consensus.
  - We were able to work in our preferred styles (async/paired/etc) on our separate portions.
  - Discussing issues together, and making well informed decisions that no-one disagreed with.
* Top 3 Things to Improve
  - We could have all met synchronously and paired for an hour or so at the beginning so that we could have been on the same page before we broke out and worked on methods separately.
  - Our git workflow could be smoother. We could have been more specific on our DTR with expectations regarding open PRs and reviews.
  - We could have communicated more via Slack messaging since we had agreed to work async and keep in touch that way on our DTR.
