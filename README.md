# Futbol

Starter repository for the [Turing School](https://turing.io/) Futbol project.

### Check-Ins
- We will be checking in daily at 7:45AM PT/10:45AM ET to quickly touch base with how people are doing that day, where they are with there currently assigned tasks, and if there are any blockers for them that they need help with.
- We will also be doing a retro on Friday at 10:00AM PT/2:00PM ET to make sure our DTR is still working as intended or if there are any adjustments that need to be made before continuing with the rest of the project.

### Project Organization & Workflow
- Individual tasks will be assigned via [Github Projects](https://github.com/users/DHowell1150/projects/3/views/1) after discussing with the group what tasks are needing to be accomplished and who is best fit to accomplish them. Nico is taking the lead on adding these tasks to the list as they come up and will be in charge of making sure they are assigned appropriately and are organized for the group effectively.
- As tasks are completed, if they are non-code related, the assignee will check off the task and notify the group that it has been completed via slack. If the task is to complete some portion of code, they will make a pull request on GitHub, notify the group, and their assigned reviewer will review the code before merging. Once it is merged, the group will be notified again by the person merging the PR so everyone is able to pull that code down and continue their own work.

### Organization Approach
- We discussed a few different methods for organization, including using a Google Sheet, Trello, and GitHub Projects. We all were interested in learning how to use an organization tool that we were unfamiliar with so we ruled out Google Sheets. From there we looked at Trello and GitHub Projects and determined GitHub Projects looked like it would be the tool best fit for our needs currently.
