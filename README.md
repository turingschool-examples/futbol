## Our plan for check-ins 
1. Daily checkins during assigned work times before we get started with async work for the day
1. Slack updates when starting async work and when finishing work with a notification of PR 


## Project Organization and workflow 
1. Project Management [Miro Board](https://miro.com/welcomeonboard/N3pkck1nUzVxZmxNRUc0cGEyWHNXMnlnUHNrUTZMZ0xRcUhCN3BHbXg1WWhRd2o0SVUxNmJYNGFWRTEzVk1wSnwzNDU4NzY0NTYwNTgyMTA5MjczfDI=?share_link_id=894479804950)
1. We async came up with our own ideas of how the project would look and then came together to compare notes and decide how we wanted to build things out together. Then we used the Miro Board to help assign people to classes. 

## Summary of different approaches discussed and how we collectively chose one to use

## Our approach to the code design
We started off with drafting out the connection between classes and class methods, looked for where we could use a parent class and utilize inheritance as well as map out the the CSVs to the class and methods. We collectively decided to all start on our spec files for each class to get an understanding of what we were building toward together.
