# Iteration 1 Deliverable

Your iteration deliverable is to create a README with the following. As you craft your answers, consider how you might talk about these same topics in a job interview after you graduate.

- A 1-2 summary or bullet points outlining your plan for check-ins throughout the duration of the project.
  - We plan to do daily check-ins at 4:15 MT. This will be a long-format check-in to review each other's code and work through any merge conflicts.

- A 2-4 sentence summary of your plan for project organization and workflow. This can include bullet points. If you plan to use a project management tool, please include a link to your project board.
  - We are managing project organization and workflow using a combination of [Trello](https://trello.com/invite/b/VgTFrhkq/ATTIc3c808683120007982b3b4a2e51917abDA312FD8/futbol) and [Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMxDEI44=/?share_link_id=119581307915). On Miro we've laid out project framework and method/module connectivity, on Trello we're keeping track of tasks, assignments, and completions.

- A 2-3 sentence summary describing the different approaches your group discussed for project organization and how you collectively made a decision on which to use.
  - We had the benefit of somebody that has already tackled a group project and talked about things that worked and didn't. Blake brought the idea of Miro board which ended up being a great way for us to get a number of ideas down and do some organization of potential file structure. In that brainstorming we talked about a number of different ways to approach the project and how we wanted our classes to interact, as well as how complex to go from the start vs dedicating time to working code with the option to refactor later.

- A 2-3 sentence summary describing your approach to the code design.
  - When we started talking about code design we had a lot of ideas, similar and different, but didn't have enough cohesion to get a good structure on the board. We were able to narrow down on our general class structure and from there things started rolling smoothly. We decided to get working code first using more basic concepts and come back to refactoring with the possibility of inheritance and more modules after our retrospective.

- Include link to your initial DTR document and the date it was completed. If you do additional DTRs later in the project, you should link the revised versions here as well with the date. New versions should be listed alongside older versions. Do not delete old DTRs.
  - [DTR](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1THbvZXybDpun9jVNwqFK_LtNJ0bsWEobJQSmpqgHYcw/edit)
  
- Create a section in your README called “Contributors”. List each group member’s name and link to their LinkedIn and Github profiles.
