## Check-ins
- Scheduled stand-ups (30ish minutes) each weekday (weekend schedule to be determined Friday at Retro)
- Slack async check-ins every two hours/even hours 
- Evening 9pm MT update/checkin, push work of the day to be ready for next standup
- If working in morning, push by scheduled stand-up 

## Plan for project organization
- [Github Projects](https://github.com/users/DChavez18/projects/1)
- [Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMBQe3Qk=/)
- Building classes to organize data/hold state of objects, then methods to call/process that data
- Mostly async, with pair/group when dealing with unproductive struggle 
- Require 2 reviewers per pull request before merging to main

## Approaches to project organization
We had a repeater in our group and we listened to his input on how his team previously used Miro board/GitHub projects. We were all more familiar with both GitHub and Miro board above the other options, too, and so went with the familiar. 
We felt using GitHub Projects would be useful since we were already using GitHub to host our project, pull requests, comments, reviews, etc. 

## Approach to code design
We reviewed iteration 2/method requirements and used the Miro board to visualize what classes would be good choices to hold the right responsibilities to organize that data. We are planning to build class by class to first have objects to hold data/state, and then work on methods to access that data/behavior.

## Retro
Tools Used: [Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/futbolprojectretro7402/m/futbolprojectretro7402/1686253588311/c385cc206826b54edbfba89527791e949ae8db2e?sender=udf60eddcf1fd211b730a6618)

What went well:
- Giving/Recieving feedback
- GitHub Project Board
- Check-Ins

What we would do differently:
- Take more breaks
- Swap/Driver Navigator more frequently
- Spec_Harness should have been added earlier
